Pattern:

The most consistent pattern is that the first \( n-2 \) rows remain unchanged in the output while the last row (or rows) undergo a transformation where zeros become specific non-zero digits based on certain criteria derived from the input matrix positions or other patterns.


Python code for performing the transformation and reversing it:


import numpy as np

def f(I: np.ndarray, O: np.ndarray) -> tuple:
    # Extract the unchanged rows from the top
    unchanged_rows = I[:-1]  # Assuming at least one row is to change.

    # Extract the last row that changes
    changing_rows = I[-1:]  # Get the last row

    # Form new input and output matrices
    new_input = np.vstack((unchanged_rows, changing_rows))
    new_output = np.vstack((unchanged_rows, O[-1:]))

    return new_input, new_output

def g(IPrime: np.ndarray, OPrime: np.ndarray) -> tuple:
    # Extract unchanged rows + reconstructed changed rows
    unchanged_rows = IPrime[:-1]
    last_changing_row = OPrime[-1:]  # Get the last row from the output

    # Form the original input and output matrices
    original_input = np.vstack((unchanged_rows, last_changing_row))
    original_output = np.vstack((unchanged_rows, last_changing_row))

    return original_input, original_output
